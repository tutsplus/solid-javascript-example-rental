# SOLID Design Principles

This is the source code provided for the [SOLID Design Principles]() course.

* The `index` page contains the original implementation of a rental plan system
  taken from a real project.
* The `refactoring` page contains an alternate, cleaner implementation of
  almost all the original features. It uses Backbone to ease the process of
  defining the domain and integrate its parts.
* The `tests` page contains a Jasmine test suite for the Backbone models that
  are used in the refactored exercise.
